UBC3V is a synthetic dataset for training and evaluation of single or multiview depth-based pose estimation techniques.
The nature of the data is similar to the data used in the famous Kinect paper of Shotton et al. [1], but with a few distinctions:

* The dataset distinguishes the back-front and left-right sides of the body.
* The camera location is relatively unconstrained.
* It is freely available to the public!
